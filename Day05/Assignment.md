## Assignment: Design an Ecommerce Website

For this assignment, you will design an ecommerce website using Figma. The website should include the following elements:

1. Home Page: The home page should include a hero section that showcases the company's products, as well as a search bar and navigation menu. It should also include a call to action button that encourages visitors to explore the website further.

2. Product Page: The product page should feature detailed product descriptions, images, pricing information, and customer reviews. It should also include a call to action button that prompts visitors to add the product to their cart.

3. Cart Page: The cart page should display the items in the user's cart, along with pricing information and a call to action button that prompts the user to checkout.

4. Checkout Page: The checkout page should include a form for the user to enter their shipping and billing information, as well as a summary of their order and pricing information.

5. Account Page: The account page should allow users to create an account, view their order history, and update their account information.

### Here are some additional guidelines to follow:

- Use Figma's design tools and features to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website design.

- Use colors, typography, and other design elements to create a consistent and cohesive visual style.

- Make sure the website is easy to navigate and understand, with clear labels and intuitive controls.

- Use Figma's prototyping feature to create an interactive prototype of your website design, demonstrating how users can navigate the different pages and interact with the different elements of the design.

- Document your design process by creating a design brief or design rationale, explaining your design choices and how they meet the needs of your target audience.

Finally, present your design to the class and explain your design decisions and the overall design process.

Good luck and have fun designing!
